## Boilerplate README

This application is an boilerplate with mongodb for nodejs.

## Getting started

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies of the app.

Create and configure .env file (you can use .example.env to know what environment variables you must define):

    PORT: This variable is the port where you want your app runs

    MONGODB_CNN: this is the url to connect to mongo data base, for this you can check [the documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/cloud-manager/tutorial/getting-started/)

Before Create and configure .env file you can use `npm start` to start your app in the port that you configured. If you run this locally you can find your api in <http://localhost:[PORT]>/api
